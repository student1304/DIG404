About These Slides
==================
Rather than traditional PowerPoint slides, for this book 
we're posting live, interactive Jupyter Notebooks and static 
HTML versions of those Jupyter Notebooks.

For those of you who are not familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, 
I recorded a video that demonstrates how to use and teach 
from the  notebooks. You can find the video on our YouTube channel
at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7ioWqUX99o&t=1s

If you have any questions at all, please reach out to paul@deitel.com 
and I will get back to you quickly.

These formats offer several benefits:
    - We believe the best way to teach from our book is using 
      the live, interactive Jupyter Notebooks. 
    - Students can see the code just like in PowerPoint, but 
      instructors can execute the code live. 
    - This builds student anticipation and helps drive classroom 
      discussions.
    - Both the Jupyter Notebooks and HTML files are browser-based, 
      so you can adjust the presentation font size easily by 
      zooming in/out in your browser.
    - The JupyterLab interface to Juptyer Notebooks includes a 
      Terminal window, so you can execute scripts from the same 
      interface. 
      
Please note that you should take the entire IntroToPythonSlides
folder and you should not move around files within that folder. 
The notebooks and HTML files link to various images that depend on 
the folder structure we defined.
